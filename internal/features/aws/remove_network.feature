@aws @remove_network
Feature: Environment apply

  Scenario: Remove a network
    Given I setup ernest with target "https://ernest.local"
    And I setup a new environment name
    When I'm logged in as "usr" / "secret123"
    And I apply the definition "aws8.yml"
    And I start recording
    And I apply the definition "aws9.yml"
    And I stop recording
    Then an event "network.delete.aws-fake" should be called exactly "1" times
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain a field "_provider" with "aws-fake"
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain a field "vpc_id" with "fakeaws"
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain a field "range" with "10.2.0.0/24"
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain an encrypted field "datacenter_region" with "fake"
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain an encrypted field "aws_access_key_id" with "up_to_16_characters_secret"
    And all "network.delete.aws-fake" messages should contain an encrypted field "aws_secret_access_key" with "fake_up_to_16_characters"
