Feature: Service apply

  Scenario: Decreasing instance count
    Given I setup ernest with target "https://ernest.local"
    And I setup a new service name
    When I'm logged in as "usr" / "secret123"
    And I apply the definition "vcloud4.yml"
    And I start recording
    And I apply the definition "vcloud3.yml"
    And I stop recording
    Then an event "instance.delete.vcloud-fake" should be called exactly "1" times
    And all "instance.delete.vcloud-fake" messages should contain a field "_provider" with "vcloud-fake"
